# Module 05 Notebook

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook for Module 05, where we analyze the acceptance rates of different types of coupons based on various demographic and behavioral factors.

## Overview

The notebook performs the following analyses:

1. **Bar Coupons Analysis**:
   - Create a new DataFrame containing only bar-related coupons.
   - Calculate the proportion of bar coupons accepted.
   - Compare acceptance rates between those who visit bars 3 or fewer times a month and those who visit more frequently.
   - Compare acceptance rates between drivers who go to bars more than once a month and are over the age of 25 to all other drivers.
   - Compare acceptance rates for drivers who frequent bars more than once a month, had passengers other than kids, and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry.

2. **Coffee House Coupons Analysis**:
   - Create a new DataFrame containing only coffee house-related coupons.
   - Calculate the overall acceptance rate for coffee house coupons.
   - Compare acceptance rates based on age groups, marital status, income groups, and occupation.

## Analysis Highlights

### Bar Coupons Analysis

- **Proportion of Bar Coupons Accepted**: Approximately 41%
- **Acceptance Rates by Frequency of Bar Visits**:
  - 3 or fewer visits per month: 37.07%
  - More than 3 visits per month: 76.88%
- **Acceptance Rates by Age and Frequency**:
  - Drivers who go to bars more than once a month and are over the age of 25: 69.52%
  - All other drivers: 33.50%
- **Acceptance Rates by Additional Criteria**:
  - Drivers who go to bars more than once a month, had passengers other than kids, and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry: [insert percentage]
